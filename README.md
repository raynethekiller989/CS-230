The Gaming Room client aimed to develop a web application enabling teams to input answers based on visual clues, transitioning from an original Android platform to reach a broader audience. Inspired by the 1980s game "Win, Lose or Draw," the client emphasized staying within budget during development. I believe I effectively captured and articulated the client's key game requirements, which proved instrumental in guiding the coding process. Clearly defining these requirements enabled a focused approach to the project. While I acknowledge the need for significant editing in my work overall, I particularly value my grasp of the advantages and disadvantages associated with various operating platforms. Understanding these nuances is crucial for anticipating challenges and making informed decisions throughout development.
I prioritize understanding the user's needs as fundamental in my approach. Continually asking myself how users would perceive and interact with my designs is crucialâ€”it's about adopting their perspective. Neglecting user needs undermines the project's purpose; I must design with the audience in mind, not for personal use. If the software is difficult for users to navigate, it risks low traffic and financial losses for the client in maintaining the site. Efficiency in storage and memory usage is paramount in software design to avoid resource-intensive problems. I find it beneficial to start with pseudocode to clarify my thoughts and plans, aiding in developing effective solutions. Rigorous unit testing and debugging are also essential steps in ensuring the project's functionality and reliability.
